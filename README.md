==============

Various projects I am creating for the purpose of learning python.  Projects will be various and probably non related.

I am currently using Python 3.4.1 for this project.

Current external libraries I am using are:

Rock Paper Scissors (Lizard Spock)
---------------------------------

Game I put together.  Code is not well documented currently.  You can play both traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors or Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

Black Jack
------------

Same as the casino game!  You will be able to do most things that can be done in the casino version.
Currently, only the basic game (hit or stay) is enabled, and while money is tracked, you don't get the opportunity to change the bet.  Showing you losing and gaining money is a bit hard to see at the moment.
