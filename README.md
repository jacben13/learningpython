Rock Paper Scissors (Lizard Spock)
---------------------------------

Game I put together.  Code is not well documented currently.  You can play both traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors or Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

Black Jack
------------

Same as the casino game!  You will be able to do most things that can be done in the casino version.
You can hit, stay, or double down. The game will also recommend moves for your current situation.
